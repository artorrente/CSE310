# Overview

My name is Alex, as a student studying Applied Programming, I am hoping to accomplish big things, particularly in network security, and software engineering.

My software that I have used would be VSCode, a variety of online compilers, in the case of C# & C++ assignments, as opposed to both PuTTy, and VSCode, as both dont seem to run on my computer, when I am coding in a C programming language (Java hasn't been attempted yet.)

My goal for this assignment was to get the assignment done.
