# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{The program I wrote was a basic tic tac toe program, it gets the users input, checks if its a number, or 1 through 9. If it fits into these things, it removes it from a main list, once this is done, the computer will select a random number from the list, and the number will be removed. if a certain series of numbers exist in either inventory, that team wins. the game board is not the list, it is a seperate array as a whole that either has numbers, an x, or an o}

{The purpose of getting this assignment done was to get the assignment done so I could get closer to a degree.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
