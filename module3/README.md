# Overview
{I want to get better about understanding how computer proramming, networking, and other things work, so that maybe when I get a COMPTIA job, I can better understand and grasp what I am doing. Starting Client or server is pretty easy honestly, just gotta follow the prompt and hit either C for client, or S for server, uppercase or lowercase, does not matter.}

# Network Communication

{I used a client server setting, which was on a TCP connection. I used port 19880, as I felt it would be nice to use, since another TCP connection uses it, this is mostly redundant though, and any port can be used. I also used localhost. The text from the users that gopes ionto the server is typed, turned into bytes, and than translated by the server, vice versa with the information coming from server to client.}
