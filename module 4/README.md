# Overview
{I did this for two reasons, one, to see what this language was about, and see if it was something that I liked, as I heard that other mobile apps had been using it, or similar languages for a long time (I believe whatsapp either used this one or kerlang). The language uses libraries primarily, ones that were already a part of the language, or maybe even the program, I am still not entirely sure to be honest. This was the biggest limitation of the language, it mostly used other peoples libraries that had already existed. The other reason I cannot say, because the instructions told me not to.}

# Development Environment
{For this assignment, I made an android app, something different about this module was that I did not use the standard program that we use in this course (Visual Studio) instead opting in to use a program specifically designed to make apps on android phones. If I had a language that I would want to go back to the least, it would probably have to be this one, I am not sure if it was the program that I used, but literally the entirety of the language was from libraries that were already a thing, unlike other languages, such as C#. }

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- making the file be able to be saved
- Making a revolving menu depending on what is clicked, if I click theh pencil tool for example, it would have pencil related options, or if a shape option was selected
